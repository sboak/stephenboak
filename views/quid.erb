<h2>Quid</h2>
<p>Quid's mission is to develop analysis and visualization tools that make fast-moving global technology developments visible, navigable, and understandable. As one of Quid's first Product Managers, I led engineering scrums and worked with the management team to define and deliver on product goals. I also designed and contributed to the development of the product front-end.</p>
